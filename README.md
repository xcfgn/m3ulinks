Hit enter and if it gives you an error for you to install dependencies type "pip install (dependency name)" and hit enter

It usually will need "requests" and "beautifulsoup4"

After you have installed the dependencies type "py script.py" again and hit enter

Now it should be like this.

Look at the folder you have extracted the script to and there should be a "channels.m3u"
